When members of staff within your department retire, there are usually office clearouts, resulting in piles of interesting old books being given away.

A recent addition to my collection is a cartographic gem from 1995 titled "Statlas UK: A Statistical Atlas of the United Kingdom", produced by the Ordnance Survey. For anyone interested in this post, you can still purchase this atlas second hand for as little as 1p from [Amazon Marketplace](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ordnance-Survey-Statlas-UK-Statistical/dp/0117018732/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389874365&sr=8-1&keywords=statlas).

Much to my surprise when I opened the atlas, some of the maps were not quite up to the refined standards of the contemporary [Ordnance Survey](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/), including:
