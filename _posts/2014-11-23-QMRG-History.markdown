Quite a long time ago I spent considerable hours trawling through QMRG reports that featured in old issues of [Area](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291475-4762) and [Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291475-5661) to examine how the committee had evolved over time. In these pre R days, I assembled these into a spreadsheet (sorry!) of both the [report text](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg/blob/master/Excel%20Files/History_Data.xlsx?raw=true), and also as a [timeline](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg/blob/master/Excel%20Files/QMRG_time_line.xlsx?raw=true). You can download both of these files on the [github repository](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg).

These files have sat on my machine for years, however, I thought they would make a nice addition to the new combined QMRG and GIScRG website - [Quantile](http://quantile.info). As such, I have generate a [D3](http://d3js.org/) timeline of the committee membership, and assembled a chronology of events - the code is also on github [here](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg).

I would not claim that this is comprehensive, and only features those entries gathered from the reports. If you were involved in the committee and are missing, or the dates are not quite correct, then let me know.
