Quite long time ago I spent considerable hours trawling through QMRG reports that featured in [Area](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291475-4762) and [Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291475-5661) to examine how the committee had evolved over time. In these pre R days, I assembled these into a spreadsheet (sorry!) of both the [report text](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg/blob/master/Excel%20Files/History_Data.xlsx?raw=true), and also as a [timeline](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg/blob/master/Excel%20Files/QMRG_time_line.xlsx?raw=true). You can download both of these files on the [github repository](https://github.com/alexsingleton/qmrg).

These files have sat on my machine for years, however, I thought they would make a nice addition to the new combined QMRG and GIScRG website - [Quantile](http://quantile.info). As such, I have generate a D3 timeline of the committee membership - the code is also on github here.
