http://www.spatialkey.com/ looks a promising new GIS based start up built around geovisualisation. Of particular note are the heat map visualisation demos which link both time and place.

It appears to be built in the new Flex framework which I think we will be seeing a lot more of in the future for these type of data rich applications.
