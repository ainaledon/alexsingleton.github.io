I have been asked on two occasions in the past month to present on the topic of my current and future research activity (both methodological and substantive). These draw together my activities over the past seven years at UCL made up of both PhD and Post Doctoral research.

I have uploaded both these talks to slideshare for anyone who is interested:

**Shorter Talk: Current and Future Research**
