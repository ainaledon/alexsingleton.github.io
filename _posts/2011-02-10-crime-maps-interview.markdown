![](public/images/BBC.jpg)A guest post I wrote for the [Floating Sheep blog](http://www.floatingsheep.org/2011/02/problem-points-on-new-uk-police-maps.html) about the new [Crime Website](http://www.police.uk/) was picked up by BBC Berkshire this morning after a tip off yesterday by [Mark Graham](http://www.geospace.co.uk/). The breadth of interest in the crime website has astounded me - both positive and negative. Another good critique is available [here](http://adrianshort.co.uk/2011/02/01/police-uk-official-crime-maps-there-should-be-a-law-against-it/).

Anyway, for those who didn't enjoy the dulcet tones of my map geekery at 7.10 this morning (and indeed my promotion to Professor), never fear, you can savour or repeat this pleasure:
