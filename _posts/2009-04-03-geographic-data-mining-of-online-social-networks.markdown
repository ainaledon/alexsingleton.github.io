I just presented this paper at [GIS Research UK (GISRUK)](http://www.ceg.ncl.ac.uk/gisruk2009/) in Durham sparking an interesting debate about ethics and use of transactional data. This is my first attempt at Keynote on OSX / Macbook - which after an initial failure at getting technology connected I am very impressed by overall.
