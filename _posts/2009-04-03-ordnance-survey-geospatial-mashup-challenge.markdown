Today was a jolly nice day with Ollie and I winning the Ordnance Survey Geospatial Mashup Challenge at GISRUK 2009. There were some really good entries and I was quite surprised with the result. One site which really impressed me was: "User Adaptive Trip Planner -Ramya Venkateswaran, Pia Bereuter, University of Zurich - hopefully this will be online soon".

Our winning site is was titled "Contextualising Educational Careers for Widening Participation in Higher Education", however is really a nice educational atlas. This should be online soon with luck, but here are a few slides to view for now:
