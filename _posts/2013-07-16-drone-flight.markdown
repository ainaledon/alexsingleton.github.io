Latest install into the lab has been a [Parrot AR.Drone 2.0](http://ardrone2.parrot.com) which are flown using wifi and an iPad or iPhone app. This drone has both a forward facing and base camera which can be used to record flights / survey. First impression is that this is pretty neat, but quite tricky to master. I note a GPS module is also available with the ability to plot flight paths which could be useful.
