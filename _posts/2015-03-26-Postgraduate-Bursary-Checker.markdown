[HEFCE](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2014/CL,322014/) have released funding prior to a full loan system being introduced that provides bursaries to students wishing to pursue postgraduate study. The ways in which this scheme are being operated by the different university are diverse, however, a number of universities include both the index of multiple deprivation and the POLAR classification of young participation rates within their metrics. 

The [website](http://opengeodemographics.com/pbec) I built aims to help simplify the process of searching these data. There are things that could be improved on this site, however, [all the code is provided on github](https://github.com/alexsingleton/PBEC).
