The "Big Society" features as a key part of the coalition government's legislative programme, aiming to decentralise control of public services and to empower local communities to manage and deliver services that better meet local needs. Over the past twelve months I have been involved in an [AHRC Funded Connected Communities ](http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/FundingOpportunities/Pages/connectedcommunities.aspx)project involving researchers at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Portsmouth, where we have been examining the various ways in the "Big Society" concept can be defined, measured, and more importantly mapped.

As part of this ongoing work we have created the following website ([http://measuringbigsociety.org/](http://measuringbigsociety.org/)) containing a short animated film about the Big Society and a survey where you can tell us how well you think Big Society will develop in your area?

**Please visit [http://measuringbigsociety.org/](http://measuringbigsociety.org/) and complete the survey!**
