[![](/public/images/front.jpg)](http://liverpool.gisruk.org/)Something else which has been keeping me busy of late is organising GISRUK 2013 which we are hosting next April at the Univerity of Liverpool.

**The deadline is approaching - 15th November; so still time to submit a paper! **

**About**

The 21st [GIS Research UK (GISRUK) conference](http://liverpool.gisruk.org/) is being hosted by the Department of Geography and Planning in School of Environmental Sciences at the University of Liverpool from Wednesday 3rd through to Friday 5th April. As with previous years, there is a day of workshops on the 2nd April, including the Young Researcher's Forum. The conference will follow the usual format of plenary sessions from invited keynote speakers, and oral presentation of papers in a series of parallel themed sessions. A full social programme will also feature during the conference.
