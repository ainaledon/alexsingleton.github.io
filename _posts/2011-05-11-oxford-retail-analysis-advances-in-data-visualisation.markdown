I have fallen a bit behind on my blog as teaching activities have ramped up. However, over the next couple of days I will sort this out and post a couple of updates. The first of these is a talk I did at University of Oxford in April for one of their [Retail Location Analysis](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/oxirm/execed/Pages/retaillocationanalysis.aspx) courses. My daughter was sick and in hospital so I recorded this the night before I was supposed to appear. It was also the first time I have used [screen capture software](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/) - this is actually very good, and no doubt I will use this again for my lectures. I did however find out that this takes a much longer time to record than doing a lecture - the temptation to re-record segments is far too tempting!
