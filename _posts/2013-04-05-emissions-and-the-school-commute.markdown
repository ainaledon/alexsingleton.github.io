This week I have been busy running around organising [GISRUK 2013](http://liverpool.gisruk.org) - however, in between this, I talked about some research I have been completing to develop a national individual level model of CO2 emissions that are linked to the school commute. For anyone who missed the talk, this was recorded by [Robin Lovelace](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace) from the University of Sheffield (thanks!) and put on YouTube.
