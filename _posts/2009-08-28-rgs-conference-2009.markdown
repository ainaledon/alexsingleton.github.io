I have just finished at the RGS conference which was hosted in the fantastic city of Manchester. I thought the line up this year was very good indeed and there were lots of interesting talks. The UCL talks from CASA comprised the QMRG session I organised on geodemographics and also a postgraduate forum / QMRG badged young researchers session. Some of these talks are online; [James Cheshire](http://jamescheshire.co.uk/2009/07/06/popfest-presentation/), Dan Lewis, [Oliver O'Brien](http://www.slideshare.net/oliverobrien/higher-education-profiling-using-open-source-gis-a-primer-on-openstreetmap-data-mapnik-openlayers), [Muhammad Adnan](http://www.slideshare.net/adnanned/real-time-geodemographics) and me.

Two other events of particular note at the conference were the launch of the [International Encyclopedia of Human Geography](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/709246/description#description) and the "Mapping Manchester: Cartographic Stories of the City" exhibition organised by [Martin Dodge](http://cyberbadger.blogspot.com/) and [Chris Perkins ](http://www.sed.manchester.ac.uk/geography/staff/perkins_chris.htm)(now known as Perkins in the [popular press](http://news.google.co.uk/news?ned=uk&hl=en&ncl=d2HMV41XZRxff3Mn_48icSK4TSGSM&output=rss)!).
