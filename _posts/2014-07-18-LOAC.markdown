[Paul Longley](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academic-staff/paul-longley) , [James Cheshire](http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/) and I have supervised the PhD of [Chris Gale](https://twitter.com/geogale) over the past couple of years which has developed the 2011 Census ONS Output Area Classification, and was released today.

During development, Paul and I were approached by the [Greater London Authority ](https://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/mayor/publications/gla-intelligence)(GLA) to develop a classification for London that mirrored [earlier work](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10109-010-0113-9) completed in relation to the 2001 OAC.

The methodology and data input for this classification followed the UK OAC 2011 specification, however, the geographic extent was constrained to Greater London. The advantage of this method, over the application of UK OAC in the context of London is that the clusters formed are more sensitive to geographic context. A full methodological report is available on the [GLA website](http://TOADD).

The London Output Area Classification can be visualised on the CDRC website - [public.cdrc.ac.uk](http://public.cdrc.ac.uk).
