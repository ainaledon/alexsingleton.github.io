Following the Educational Reform Act of 1988, families in England and  Wales have been free to identify a preferred school for their  childrenâ€™s secondary education. However, as part of this open selection,  the demand from parents opting to send their children to the best  performing schools far outstrips the supply of available places at them,  and consequently many schools ration places using entry criteria that  favour those pupils domiciled close to the school. Through this  geographic selection process, choice is spatially sorted and access to  the best schools is often crucially dependent upon where parents live.  After illustrating this problem, this paper develops an automated  modelling technique that can be used to define and map school catchment  areas based on the home locations of pupils attending every publically  funded school in England. It then develops this framework to create a  web based decision support tool to aid parents seeking secondary school  places.
