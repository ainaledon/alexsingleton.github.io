[Wikileaks ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks)released the IED attack locations between 2004 - 2009. The Guardian have cleaned up the data and done some nice mapping [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/datablog/2010/jul/26/wikileaks-afghanistan-ied-attacks). Coinciding with the arrival of my new workstation and ArcGIS install I decided to do some mapping myself. I have put all these images in a slideshow:

In addition I created this animated gif which illustrates the IED locations and intensity over time.
