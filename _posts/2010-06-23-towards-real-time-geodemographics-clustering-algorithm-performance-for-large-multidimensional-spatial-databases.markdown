Geodemographic classifications provide discrete indicators of the  social, economic and demographic characteristics of people living within  small geographic areas. They have hitherto been regarded as products,  which are the final "best" outcome that can be achieved using available  data and algorithms. However, reduction in computational cost, increased  network bandwidths and increasingly accessible spatial data  infrastructures have together created the potential for the creation of  classifications in near real time within distributed online  environments. Yet paramount to the creation of truly real time  geodemographic classifications is the ability for software to process  and efficiency cluster large multidimensional spatial databases within a  timescale that is consistent with online user interaction. To this end,  this article evaluates the computational efficiency of a number of  clustering algorithms with a view to creating geodemographic  classifications "on the fly" at a range of different geographic scales.
